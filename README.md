# Fake_News_Detection
This project uses an LSTM-based deep learning model to classify news articles as FAKE or REAL. It leverages word embeddings (like Word2Vec or GloVe) to capture semantic meaning in the text. The model is trained on a labeled dataset of news articles and achieves high accuracy in detecting misinformation. The app is deployed using Streamlit for easy interaction and live prediction.
